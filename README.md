# Data Structures and Algorithms

Programming languages come and go. At the most fundamental level, data structures and algorithms play an irreplaceable role in the software field. This repository will be used to host all the data structures and algorithms that Wei Kang has implemented with Python. Hopefully it would be useful for you. It's entirely open source, you are welcome to grab a copy and have a fun time playing with it. It'll be even greater if you'll like to have a discussion with me! Thank you. - Tan Wei Kang
